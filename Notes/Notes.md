# this is a list of different types of budgets that we can offer 
## zero based 
steps to impelment 
1. collect the total income 
   > What counts as income? Your regular paychecks and anything extra you plan to bring in during the month (think side hustles or child support). Write it all down and add it up! That’s your total monthly income, aka what you’ve got to work with this month.
2. list expenses
Giving (This should be 10% of your income.)
Savings (This depends on your Baby Step, which we’ll explain later.)
The Four Walls (These are the top bills to cover: food, utilities, shelter and transportation.)
Other essentials (We’re talking about insurance, debt, childcare, etc.)
Extras (Here’s the fun part: entertainment, fun money, restaurants, etc.)
Month-specific expenses (Any holidays, celebrations or semiannual expenses due this month?)
